     <p id="Horrificus Paragraph">
      Horrificus is an dungeon crawler game developed by the Original Gamesters about a corrupt wolf lord who was defeated in battle and must venture his way through many challenging levels. Luckily, chests are scattered around the dungeons that carry valuable weapons to aid you. Power-ups like the speedy croissant are also placed around the castle to help on your short but wicked journey. After preparing, you will find your way to the Princess. Duel her to decide your fate.

      A dark lord howls his battle cry, leading his army into battle. He is charging at his greatest enemy, the Knight, in order to finish off the Golden Empire once and for all. He had scouted the Bright Castle for a weak point, he found one near the stables on the backside of the castle. After sneaking in, he rushes to the throne room. The princess, his target, isn‚Äôt there. He can‚Äôt see who it is through the golden suit of armor, but then he realizes. It is the Knight. He strikes unexpectedly, injuring Cyrus‚Äôs leg. Angered, the wolf circles the Knight and slashes with his sword and bites at his shoulders. Their swords meet, colliding mid-swing. ‚ÄúYou think you have beaten me‚Äù snarls the wolf, ‚ÄúI already have‚Äù says the Knight in return. ‚ÄúYou forgot one thing: b-b-b-BACKSWING!‚Äù  And with a heavy slice, the Knight‚Äôs hand is cut off and the rest of his arm is bleeding from all sides. While the wolf is celebrating, a small red dot comes from the distance. The fireball shoots at him at incredible speeds and hits him from behind. The wolf, Cyrus, you, fall down, incapacitated...

      Gato Exploso is a game about a cat with an arsenal of explosives. He must rescue his parents from the clutches of the mighty, cheesy, Ham Sandwich before they become sandwiches themselves. The player will travel through a procedurally generated world with biomes such as ocean, plains, forest, and hills.

      The Story:

    <p>
      When his parents are kidnapped by the Ham Sandwich, Gato Exploso must talk to a turtle that goes by the name of Squirell to find him. Squirell tells Gato about an old wise turtle in a village that knows the location of the Ham Sandwich. He travels there with the help of Squirell and finds Hammy. Gato and he prepare for a battle to the death. Ready your hand grenades!

          Bouncy Triangle

        <li>
          Ham Sandwich
        </li>
      </ul>
      The mobs' hostility levels will cycle through, so pay attention to if they are hostile or not. For example, when a Bouncy Traingle is red, it means it is hostile, but if it is green, it is peaceful. Ostriches are mobs found in the open, but another person can join in on another device to play as one. A Cloud is a cloud that shoots lightning bolts at Gato. The final boss is the Ham Sandwhich.
