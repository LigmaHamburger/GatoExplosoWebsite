     <p id="Horrificus Paragraph">
      Horrificus is an dungeon crawler game developed by the Original Gamesters about a corrupt wolf lord who was defeated in battle and must venture his way through many challenging levels. Luckily, chests are scattered around the dungeons that carry valuable weapons to aid you. Power-ups like the speedy croissant are also placed around the castle to help on your short but wicked journey. After preparing, you will find your way to the Princess. Duel her to decide your fate.

     <p>
      A dark lord howls his battle cry, leading his army into battle. He is charging at his greatest enemy, the Knight, in order to finish off the Golden Empire once and for all. He had scouted the Bright Castle for a weak point, he found one near the stables on the backside of the castle. After sneaking in, he rushes to the throne room. The princess, his target, isn‚Äôt there. He can‚Äôt see who it is through the golden suit of armor, but then he realizes. It is the Knight. He strikes unexpectedly, injuring Cyrus‚Äôs leg. Angered, the wolf circles the Knight and slashes with his sword and bites at his shoulders. Their swords meet, colliding mid-swing. ‚ÄúYou think you have beaten me‚Äù snarls the wolf, ‚ÄúI already have‚Äù says the Knight in return. ‚ÄúYou forgot one thing: b-b-b-BACKSWING!‚Äù  And with a heavy slice, the Knight‚Äôs hand is cut off and the rest of his arm is bleeding from all sides. While the wolf is celebrating, a small red dot comes from the distance. The fireball shoots at him at incredible speeds and hits him from behind. The wolf, Cyrus, you, fall down, incapacitated...

      The Story:
    </h4>
    <p>
      One day, at Kitty Cat College, a young cat named Gato came into his class for show and tell. Gato had his lunch bag, magic wand, and magic hat prepared for his demonstration. His parents had laughed at him when he said he wanted to be a magician, but he was going to prove them wrong. 
      ‚ÄúGato, your turn,‚Äù his teacher called. He stood up. This was the moment he had been preparing for. He turned to face his peers and announced: ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show you will ever see.‚Äù With that, he pulled out his bag and wand, put on his hat, and began chanting. 
      ‚ÄúAbracadabra alakazam change is the cheese into muenster!‚Äù The God of Magic must have misheard him, because he turned the cheese into a monster. A big, greasy, cheesy monster. A monster needs armor, the monster thought. He grabbed the ham and bread and wrapped them around him. The Ham Sandwich stared at Gato. 
      He shouted ‚ÄúYou trapped me in the bag with apples everyday for four years! I shall kill you!‚Äù Gato stuttered ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me, I swear. It was my parents!‚Äù ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù the behemoth sub said, ‚ÄúI shall kill them!‚Äù 
      The Ham Sandwich flew through the ceiling and launched away. My parents!, Gato thought. He burst out of the school, sprinting through the campus, adrenaline pumping through him. He banged his front door open, and rushed to warn his parents. They were in the living room, watching TV. Suddenly, the roof of his house flew off. It was the Ham Sandwich! The Ham Sandwich grabbed Gato‚Äôs parents, jumped up, and launched into the distance. Gato‚Äôs mind raced. He remembered the storage of weapons his dad kept in case of a robber. He ran to the closet and grabbed what he hoped to find. The bag of grenades. Gato donned the belt full of grenades and walked out his house. He was Gato Exploso. You are Gato Exploso‚Ä¶

          Bouncy Triangle

        </li>
        <li>
          Ham Sandwich
        </li>
      </ul>
      The mobs' hostility levels will cycle through, so pay attention to if they are hostile or not. For example, when a Bouncy Traingle is red, it means it is hostile, but if it is green, it is peaceful. Ostriches are mobs found in the open, but another person can join in on another device to play as one. A Gues is a goat on a cloud that can zap you with lightning bolts. The final boss is the Ham Sandwhich.

      <br>
‚ÄúToday we continued working on Gato Exploso. Development is going well. The music is nearly finished. Gameplay is solid, and playable at the moment. The story is currently in progress. At the moment, the art is about halfway done. All sfx has been created and will be implemented soon. This blog will be updated once every meeting. We will continue to work on it.‚Äù
      <br>
‚ÄúBefore we began the blog, we cleared many obstacles. One of the obstacles for us was to figure out how each character should be represented. Gato was originally planned to have stars for eyes, and more bombs were planned, including dynamite and an airstrike. Ever since then, we‚Äôve stuck to a model of him with no stars on his eyes, and 4 bombs. We also eliminated certain bosses, such as the sand snake and the troll, for simplicity.‚Äù
      <br>
‚ÄúSoon enough, we plan on simplifying the design of the ham sandwich so he fits in with the other assets in the game. We need certain models to replace the hitboxes in the actual game. All in all, the game is doing very well, and although there are several features yet to implement, there is no rush.‚Äù

        <br>
        ‚ÄúFerris is currently working on the website. Brandon is joining our TMS page as he originally did not have a way to access the site. Josh is working on a time schedule for our team and the next 12 meetings. Anna is working on the day and night sprites that will soon be incorporated into the game. I, Mario, am making the music less intense than the previous version.‚Äù
        <br>
        ‚ÄúWe have also been planning ahead. We have our team logs set up for the next few weeks. Brandon now has the job for next time he goes to Josh‚Äôs house, he will playtest the game and look for seeds.‚Äù
