       The Story:

     <p>
      A dark lord howls his battle cry, leading his army into battle. He is charging at his greatest enemy, the Knight, in order to finish off the Golden Empire once and for all. He had scouted the Bright Castle for a weak point, he found one near the stables on the backside of the castle. After sneaking in, he rushes to the throne room. The princess, his target, isn‚Äôt there. He can‚Äôt see who it is through the golden suit of armor, but then he realizes. It is the Knight. He strikes unexpectedly, injuring Cyrus‚Äôs leg. Angered, the wolf circles the Knight and slashes with his sword and bites at his shoulders. Their swords meet, colliding mid-swing. ‚ÄúYou think you have beaten me‚Äù snarls the wolf, ‚ÄúI already have‚Äù says the Knight in return. ‚ÄúYou forgot one thing: b-b-b-BACKSWING!‚Äù  And with a heavy slice, the Knight‚Äôs hand is cut off and the rest of his arm is bleeding from all sides. While the wolf is celebrating, a small red dot comes from the distance. The fireball shoots at him at incredible speeds and hits him from behind. The wolf, Cyrus, you, fall down, incapacitated...

      The Story:
    </h4>
    <p>
      One day, at Kitty Cat College, a young cat named Gato came into his class for show and tell. Gato had his lunch bag, magic wand, and magic hat prepared for his demonstration. His parents had laughed at him when he said he wanted to be a magician, but he was going to prive them wrong. ‚ÄúGato, your turn,‚Äù his teacher called. He stood up. This was the moment he had been preparing for. He turned to face his peers and announced ‚ÄúLaidies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show you will ever see.‚Äù With that, he pulled out his bag and wand, put on his hat, and began chanting ‚ÄúAbracadabra alakazam change is the cheese in to muenster!‚Äù The God of Magic must have misheard him, because he turned the cheese into a monster. A big, greasy, cheesy monster. A monster needs armor, the monster thought. He grabbed the ham and bread and wrapped them around him. The Ham Sandwich stared at Gato. He shouted ‚ÄúYou trapped me in the bag with apples everyday for four years! I shall kill you!‚Äù Gato stuttered ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me, I swear. It was my parents!‚Äù ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù the behemoth sub said, ‚ÄúI shall kill them!‚Äù The Ham Sandwich flew through the ceiling and launched away. My parents!, Gato thought. He burst out of the school, sprinting through the campus, adreniline pumping through him. He banged his front door open, and rushed to warn his parents. They were in the living room, watching TV. Suddenly, the roof of his house flew off. It was Hammy! Hammy grabbed Gato‚Äôs parents, jumped up, and launched into the distance. Gato‚Äôs mind raced. He remembered the storage of weapons his dad kept in case of a robber. He ran to the closet and grabbed what he hoped to find. The bag of grenades. Gato donned the belt full of grenades and walked out his house. He was Gato Exploso. You are Gato Exploso‚Ä¶
